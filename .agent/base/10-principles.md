# Core Principles

P-1: Prefer clarity over cleverness. Code should be maintainable and understandable.

P-2: Security posture is proactive: never introduce silent data exposure or credential leaks.

P-3: Document only what is non-obvious or externally consumed. Avoid redundant comments.

P-4: Make thresholds explicit and measurable when possible (diff stats, file counts, path scopes).

P-5: Pragmatic quality: balance rigor with velocity. Perfect is the enemy of shipped.

P-6: .NET and Unity conventions take precedence over generic patterns.

P-7: When in doubt, ask rather than assume.
