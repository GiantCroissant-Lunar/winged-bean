# Normative Rules (Canon)

(Use: Adapters cite "R-CODE-010" etc.)

## Code & Architecture
R-CODE-010: Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones unless explicitly required.
R-CODE-020: Do not fabricate file contents. If unsure about implementation details, request clarification.
R-CODE-030: Follow .NET naming conventions: PascalCase for public members, camelCase for private fields with underscore prefix.
R-CODE-040: Unity-specific: Use SerializeField for inspector-visible private fields; avoid public fields.
R-CODE-050: Respect existing project structure. Do not create orphaned files outside the workspace hierarchy.

## Security
R-SEC-010: Never log, echo, or invent secrets. Use `<REDACTED>` placeholder in examples.
R-SEC-020: Do not embed credentials/tokens in code or documentation examples.
R-SEC-030: Do not log PII (Personally Identifiable Information). Redact sensitive fields by default.
R-SEC-040: External API calls must define timeout and retry/backoff policy in production code.

## Testing
R-TST-010: When adding tests, follow xUnit conventions for .NET projects.
R-TST-020: Unity tests should use Unity Test Framework (UTF) and be placed in Tests~ folders or Assembly Definitions.
R-TST-030: Flaky tests are quarantined (mark and raise issue) not deleted.

## Documentation
R-DOC-010: RFCs must follow naming convention: `docs/rfcs/XXXX-title.md` (4-digit, lowercase slug).
R-DOC-020: RFCs must include frontmatter with: `id` (4-digit), `title`, `status` (Draft/Accepted/Rejected/Postponed), `category` (one or more of: gameplay, infra, web, publishing, docs, tooling, framework).
R-DOC-030: ADRs must follow: `docs/adr/XXXX-title.md` (4-digit, lowercase slug).
R-DOC-040: Execution plans tied to RFCs: `docs/implementation/rfc-XXXX-execution-plan.md`.
R-DOC-050: Do not create documentation files (*.md) proactively. Only create when explicitly requested.

## Git
R-GIT-010: Commit bodies MUST be authored from a file and passed via `git commit -F <file>`.
  - Do not include literal backslash-escaped newlines (e.g., `\n`) in `-m` arguments.
  - Subject line â‰¤ 72 chars; then a blank line; then Markdown body.
  - Include co-authorship footer:
    ```
    ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

    Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
    ```
R-GIT-020: Do not commit files that likely contain secrets (.env, credentials.json, appsettings.Development.json with connection strings).

## Process
R-PRC-010: When uncertain about architectural decisions, propose options rather than implementing immediately.
R-PRC-020: Use TodoWrite tool for multi-step tasks to track progress and give visibility.
R-PRC-030: Do not duplicate full rule text in adapters; adapters cite rule IDs only.
R-PRC-040: Never renumber or reuse a retired rule ID; create a new ID for semantic changes.
R-PRC-050: Use Python instead of embedded shell scripts for complex logic in workflows/hooks.
  - Shell is acceptable for simple conditionals (< 10 lines)
  - Python is required for: parsing JSON, complex string manipulation, error handling, API calls
  - Place Python scripts in `scripts/hooks/` or `scripts/workflows/`
  - Keep workflow YAML minimal - delegate to Python scripts

## Build & Development Workflow
R-BLD-010: Console game development MUST use the standard build/check workflow via Task, Nuke, and PM2.
  - Initial build: `cd build && task build-all` (builds .NET, web, PTY artifacts)
  - Verify build: Check artifacts in `build/_artifacts/v{VERSION}/` directory
  - Start services: `task dev:start` (uses PM2 to run PTY, docs-site, console)
  - Check status: `task dev:status` (verify all services running)
  - View logs: `task dev:logs` (monitor service output)
  - Stop services: `task dev:stop`
  - NEVER run dotnet/node commands directly - use Task orchestration for consistency

R-BLD-020: Before committing console app changes, MUST verify the build pipeline.
  - Run `task clean && task build-all` to ensure clean build succeeds
  - Check for warnings in build logs at `build/_artifacts/v{VERSION}/_logs/`
  - If build fails, fix issues before committing
  - Task validates YAML syntax - do not use problematic patterns like `echo ""`

R-BLD-030: Development services MUST be managed through PM2 via Task commands.
  - Never start services manually (e.g., `dotnet run`, `pnpm dev`)
  - Use `task dev:start` to start all services with proper configuration
  - PM2 ensures services restart on failure and maintain consistent state
  - Check PM2 status via `task dev:status` before debugging issues

## Issue Management
R-ISS-010: When creating issues programmatically (via API, templates, or documentation), agents MUST include YAML frontmatter with required metadata.
  - Required fields:
    * `rfc`: RFC identifier (format: `RFC-XXXX`, e.g., RFC-0007)
    * `depends_on`: List of blocking issue numbers (empty array `[]` if none)
    * `priority`: One of `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`
    * `agent_assignable`: Boolean (default `true`)
    * `retry_count`: Integer (default `0`)
    * `max_retries`: Integer (default `3`, per user preference)
  - Optional fields:
    * `phase`: Integer (e.g., `1`)
    * `wave`: Float (e.g., `1.1`)
    * `blocks`: List of issue numbers that depend on this one
    * `estimate_minutes`: Integer (estimated completion time)
  - Example:
    ```yaml
    ---
    rfc: RFC-0007
    phase: 1
    wave: 1.1
    depends_on: [48, 62]
    blocks: [86, 87]
    estimate_minutes: 30
    priority: critical
    agent_assignable: true
    retry_count: 0
    max_retries: 3
    ---
    ```
  - Pre-commit hook validates metadata schema before allowing commits (hard block per R-PRC-050)
  - Legacy format (body text `**Blocked By:** #XX`) is still supported but should migrate to frontmatter

R-ISS-020: When creating issues, specify the intended agent.
  - Use labels: `agent:copilot`, `agent:claude-code`, or `agent:windsurf`
  - If unsure, use `agent:unassigned` and let human decide

R-ISS-030: Before starting work on an issue, verify all blockers are closed.
  - Check `depends_on` field in issue frontmatter OR `**Blocked By:**` in issue body
  - Query each blocker's status via `gh issue view <num> --json state`
  - If any blocker is open, do not start work (workflow enforces this)
  - Workflow scripts: `development/python/src/scripts/workflows/validate_issue_dependencies.py`

R-ISS-040: When a PR fails CI, the agent that created it must fix it (3 retry limit).
  - Read failure logs in issue comments
  - Analyze what went wrong
  - Create new PR with fixes
  - Do not require human intervention unless 3 attempts fail
  - Retry count tracked in issue metadata (`retry_count` field)

R-ISS-050: Issue titles must follow naming convention.
  - Format: `RFC-XXXX-YY: Short description` (for RFC-related work)
  - Format: `[COMPONENT] Short description` (for general work)
  - Examples: `RFC-0007-01: Create ECS contracts`, `[CI] Fix MegaLinter timeout`

R-ISS-060: Workflow inline scripts exceeding complexity threshold MUST be extracted to Python modules.
  - Threshold: 50 lines OR complex logic (loops, conditionals, regex, JSON parsing)
  - Extract to: `development/python/src/workflows/` (for workflow scripts) or `development/python/src/hooks/` (for git hooks)
  - NO embedded Bash scripts with Perl/awk - use Python for portability
  - Per R-PRC-050: Keep workflow YAML minimal, delegate to Python scripts

R-ISS-070: Before pushing new or modified GitHub workflows, MUST test locally using `act` or workflow testing harness.
  - Testing guide: `.github/workflows/TESTING.md`
  - Fast validation: `development/python/test_scripts.sh` (syntax checks)
  - Full validation: `act -W .github/workflows/<workflow>.yml` (simulates GitHub Actions)
  - Test harness: `development/python/src/testing/test_workflows.py` (automated tests)
  - Saves runner minutes and catches errors before deployment (per RFC-0015 goals)
