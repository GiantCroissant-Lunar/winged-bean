> What is the difference between DungeonGame and ConsoleDungeon? the names are confusing

⏺ ConsoleDungeon is the host application (the .exe that runs), while DungeonGame is a plugin that provides the game logic.

  ConsoleDungeon.Host
  - Executable host application
  - Located in development/dotnet/console/src/host/ConsoleDungeon.Host/
  - Provides plugin loading infrastructure via Registry/PluginLoader
  - Manages the terminal/PTY interface

  WingedBean.Plugins.DungeonGame
  - Plugin that implements game logic (ECS systems, game state)
  - Located in development/dotnet/console/src/plugins/WingedBean.Plugins.DungeonGame/
  - Provides IDungeonGameService
  - Contains systems (Movement, Combat, AI, Render)

  WingedBean.Plugins.ConsoleDungeon
  - Another plugin that provides the Terminal.Gui UI layer
  - Located in development/dotnet/console/src/plugins/WingedBean.Plugins.ConsoleDungeon/
  - Provides ITerminalApp via ConsoleDungeonApp
  - Handles terminal rendering and input

  The architecture: ConsoleDungeon.Host (host) loads → WingedBean.Plugins.ConsoleDungeon (UI plugin) + WingedBean.Plugins.DungeonGame (game logic
  plugin).

> "WingedBean.Plugins.ConsoleDungeon" if this has something to do rleated to ui, the name is not good enough. "WingedBean.Plugins.DungeonGame" it
seems that we need to split it into more projects later.

⏺ Agreed on both points.

  WingedBean.Plugins.ConsoleDungeon - Poor naming because:
  - "ConsoleDungeon" implies it's the game itself, not the UI layer
  - Doesn't indicate it's Terminal.Gui-specific
  - Better names: WingedBean.Plugins.TerminalUI or WingedBean.Plugins.TerminalGuiHost

  WingedBean.Plugins.DungeonGame - Needs splitting because:
  - Currently mixes game logic, ECS systems, services, and components
  - Should separate into:
    - WingedBean.Plugins.DungeonGame.Core - game state, services
    - WingedBean.Plugins.DungeonGame.Systems - ECS systems (Movement, Combat, AI)
    - WingedBean.Plugins.DungeonGame.Components - ECS components
    - Possibly WingedBean.Plugins.DungeonGame.Rendering - render logic

  Want me to create an RFC for the refactoring plan, or just keep this as a known issue for later?

"WingedBean.Plugins.ConsoleDungeon"?

⏺ Yes, there's duplication:

  WingedBean.Plugins.TerminalUI
  - Generic Terminal.Gui v2 demo plugin
  - Provides ITerminalUIService
  - Hardcoded demo UI (title, buttons, time display, recording controls)
  - Not game-specific

  WingedBean.Plugins.ConsoleDungeon
  - Game-specific Terminal.Gui application
  - Provides ITerminalApp
  - Integrates with IDungeonGameService, IRenderService, IGameUIService
  - Handles game rendering, player input, ECS subscriptions
  - 800+ lines in ConsoleDungeonApp.cs

  The problem: Both wrap Terminal.Gui but serve different purposes:
  - TerminalUI = generic Terminal.Gui service (likely obsolete/demo code)
  - ConsoleDungeon = actual game UI implementation

  Likely situation: WingedBean.Plugins.TerminalUI was an early proof-of-concept that's no longer needed. The real game UI lives in ConsoleDungeon.

  Should we:
  1. Delete WingedBean.Plugins.TerminalUI (if it's unused/obsolete)
  2. Keep it if it serves as infrastructure for other Terminal.Gui apps
  3. Investigate which one ConsoleDungeon.Host actually loads

  Want me to check the host's plugins.json to see which is actually loaded?

> Wait if "WingedBean.Plugins.ConsoleDungeon" is a plugin, why it has so many code in "800+ lines in ConsoleDungeonApp.cs"? We need to talk about
Terminal.Gui v2 in more detail. As a game should have UI and Scene service(system), following 4 tiered service architecture, we should have these
two services as plugin by now. But the real service(tier 3) or provider(tier 4) should use Terminal.Gui v2 to provide the real behavior. Is this
the case for our game app?

⏺ Excellent question. Let me examine the architecture to see if we're following the 4-tiered service pattern correctly.

⏺ Now I see the architecture problem clearly. Let me check what ConsoleDungeonApp is doing:

⏺ Search(pattern: "new Window|Application\.Init|Terminal\.Gui", path: "development/dotnet/console/src/plugins/WingedBean.Plugins.ConsoleDungeon", glob:
         "ConsoleDungeonApp.cs", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 16 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ You're absolutely right! This violates the 4-tiered architecture. Here's the problem:

  Current broken architecture:

  ConsoleDungeonApp (800+ lines)
  ├─ DIRECTLY calls Terminal.Gui (Application.Init, new Window, etc.)
  ├─ DIRECTLY manages Terminal.Gui window, labels, inputs
  ├─ DIRECTLY handles Terminal.Gui key events
  └─ Uses IRenderService & IGameUIService (correct) but...
     └─ GameUIServiceProvider ALSO uses Terminal.Gui directly (correct tier 4)

  What's wrong:

  1. ConsoleDungeonApp is NOT a proper tier 3 plugin - it's directly coupled to Terminal.Gui v2
  2. GameUIServiceProvider (tier 4) exists but is underutilized - it only handles menu dialogs, not the main window/UI loop
  3. Two places manage Terminal.Gui - ConsoleDungeonApp AND GameUIServiceProvider both call Terminal.Gui APIs

  What the 4-tier architecture should be:

  Tier 1: Contracts
  ├─ ITerminalApp (host contract)
  ├─ IRenderService (game world rendering)
  ├─ IGameUIService (UI management)
  └─ ISceneService (should exist but doesn't?)

  Tier 2: Framework services (orchestration)

  Tier 3: Plugin (game logic)
  └─ ConsoleDungeonApp should ONLY:
      - Call IRenderService.Render()
      - Call IGameUIService methods
      - Handle game state/logic
      - NO direct Terminal.Gui calls

  Tier 4: Provider (Terminal.Gui implementation)
  └─ TerminalGuiProvider should:
      - Implement IGameUIService completely
      - Own Application.Init(), Window, all Terminal.Gui APIs
      - Provide Initialize(), Run(), CreateWindow(), HandleInput()
      - Be the ONLY place that knows about Terminal.Gui

  The fix: We need to extract ALL Terminal.Gui code from ConsoleDungeonApp into a proper tier 4 provider, and make ConsoleDungeonApp consume
  services instead of implementing them.

  Want me to create an RFC for this refactoring?

⏺ You're right! Looking at the git history, WingedBean.Plugins.TerminalUI was created on Sept 30, 2025 (commit 07f18b2), which is relatively
  recent. Let me compare it against the current ConsoleDungeonApp:

  WingedBean.Plugins.TerminalUI (created Sept 30)
  - Provides ITerminalUIService
  - Has hardcoded demo UI (time display, button, text field, menu bar)
  - 210 lines total
  - Created as a proof-of-concept for tier 4 Terminal.Gui provider

  WingedBean.Plugins.ConsoleDungeon
  - Still has 800+ lines directly calling Terminal.Gui
  - Implements ITerminalApp (host contract)
  - Mixes game logic with Terminal.Gui calls

  The situation:

  Yes, WingedBean.Plugins.TerminalUI was likely created as part of the tiered design refactoring, BUT:

  1. ITerminalUIService is too limited - only has Initialize(), Run(), GetScreenContent() - not enough for a full game UI
  2. The demo implementation is a POC - not production-ready for the game
  3. ConsoleDungeonApp hasn't been refactored yet to use it

  What needs to happen:

  The ITerminalUIService contract needs to be expanded to support everything ConsoleDungeonApp currently does directly:
  - Window creation/management
  - Widget management (labels, status bar, game view)
  - Input handling and event routing
  - UI updates from background threads

  Then ConsoleDungeonApp can be refactored to consume ITerminalUIService instead of Terminal.Gui directly.

  Should I check if there's already an RFC or issue tracking this refactoring work?
