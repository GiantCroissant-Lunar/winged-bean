# GitHub Automation - Critical Issues Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-02  
**Status:** Discussion  
**Author:** GitHub Copilot  
**Project:** WingedBean  

---

## Executive Summary

After reviewing the `ithome-ironman-2025` workflows and discussing with the team, **three critical blockers** prevent adoption:

1. üî¥ **BLOCKER #1:** Runner minute consumption (~43,230 min/month = $330/month cost)
2. üî¥ **BLOCKER #2:** No cross-agent issue dependency management
3. üî¥ **BLOCKER #3:** Stalled PR cleanup doesn't handle linked issues properly

**Revised Recommendation:** **DO NOT adopt any workflows** until these foundational problems are solved.

---

## Problem #1: Runner Minute Explosion üí∏

### Current State in `ithome-ironman-2025`

The reference project uses **13 cron-based workflows** with aggressive polling:

| Workflow | Frequency | Runs/Day | Est. Min/Day | Monthly Cost |
|----------|-----------|----------|--------------|--------------|
| `auto-approve-workflows.yml` | Every 2 min | 720 | 360 | $86.40 |
| `flow-monitor-shadow.yml` | Every 5 min | 288 | 288 | $69.12 |
| `pr-flow-monitor.yml` | Every 5 min | 288 | 288 | $69.12 |
| `chain-health-scan.yml` | Every 10 min | 144 | 144 | $34.56 |
| `rfc-assign-cron.yml` | Every 10 min | 144 | 144 | $34.56 |
| `rfc-cleanup-duplicates.yml` | Every 10 min | 144 | 144 | $34.56 |
| `test-diagnostic-workflow.yml` | Every 30 min | 48 | 48 | $11.52 |
| Other daily jobs | Various | ‚Äî | 25 | $6.00 |

**Total Monthly Cost:** ~$329.84 (41,230 overage minutes @ $0.008/min)

### Why This Happens

‚ùå **Anti-Pattern:** Polling instead of event-driven workflows

```yaml
# BAD: Polls every 2 minutes looking for work
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/2 * * * *'  # 720 runs/day!
```

```yaml
# GOOD: Only runs when actual event occurs
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
```

### Impact on WingedBean

If we adopted these workflows as-is:

- **Free Tier (2,000 min/month):** Overrun by Day 2 (~1,441 min/day)
- **Team Plan (3,000 min/month):** Overrun by Day 3
- **Enterprise (50,000 min/month):** Overrun by Day 35

**Conclusion:** Cron-based polling is **financially unsustainable** for any tier.

---

## Problem #2: Cross-Agent Issue Dependency Management üîó

### Current State

**WingedBean has multiple agents:**
- GitHub Copilot (CLI-based, PR-driven)
- Claude Code (deep analysis, architectural work)
- Windsurf (context-aware editing)

**Problem:** When different agents create issues, dependencies are not tracked.

**Example Scenario:**

```
RFC-0012: Save/Load System
‚îú‚îÄ Issue #45: Design state serialization (Claude Code)
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Depends on: RFC-0007 (ECS implementation)
‚îú‚îÄ Issue #46: Implement save manager (Copilot)
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Depends on: Issue #45 (design must be done first)
‚îî‚îÄ Issue #47: Add load UI (Windsurf)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Depends on: Issue #46 (save manager must exist)
```

**Current Reality:**
- ‚ùå Issue #46 gets assigned to Copilot before #45 is done
- ‚ùå Copilot starts work without design doc
- ‚ùå PR fails CI because ECS contracts don't exist
- ‚ùå Wasted runner minutes, wasted agent time

### What `ithome-ironman-2025` Does (Inadequate)

1. **Micro-issue numbering** (RFC-014-01, RFC-014-02, etc.)
   - Assumes strict sequential execution
   - No cross-RFC dependencies
   - Breaks when issues are created out of order

2. **Assignment mutex** (`rfc_assignment_mutex.py`)
   - Only prevents concurrent assignment in same RFC series
   - Doesn't check if dependencies are complete
   - No validation of readiness

3. **No dependency graph**
   - No way to express "Issue A blocks Issue B"
   - No way to prevent premature assignment

### What We Need

A **dependency-aware issue management system** that:

‚úÖ Tracks cross-issue dependencies (not just RFC sequences)
‚úÖ Validates all blockers are resolved before assignment
‚úÖ Works across different agents (Copilot, Claude, Windsurf)
‚úÖ Supports parallel work when dependencies allow
‚úÖ Prevents wasted work on blocked issues

### GitHub Native Options

**Option A: Task Lists (GitHub Projects Beta)**

```markdown
## Issue #45: Design state serialization

**Dependencies:**
- #40 RFC-0007 ECS implementation

**Blocks:**
- #46 Implement save manager
- #47 Add load UI
```

**Pros:**
- Native GitHub feature
- Visual dependency graph
- No custom code needed

**Cons:**
- Requires GitHub Projects (manual setup)
- No automated enforcement
- Can't prevent assignment if blockers exist

---

**Option B: Custom Labels + Workflow Validation**

```yaml
# Issue labels
dependencies: blocked-by:#45
status: blocked
```

```yaml
# Workflow validation
- name: Check dependencies before assignment
  run: |
    ISSUE_BODY=$(gh issue view $ISSUE_NUM --json body -q .body)
    BLOCKED_BY=$(echo "$ISSUE_BODY" | grep -oP 'blocked-by:#\K\d+' || echo "")
    
    if [ -n "$BLOCKED_BY" ]; then
      STATUS=$(gh issue view "$BLOCKED_BY" --json state -q .state)
      if [ "$STATUS" != "closed" ]; then
        echo "ERROR: Issue #$BLOCKED_BY must be closed first"
        exit 1
      fi
    fi
```

**Pros:**
- Automated enforcement
- Works with any agent
- Prevents premature assignment

**Cons:**
- Requires custom workflow logic
- Label parsing is brittle
- Doesn't visualize dependency graph

---

**Option C: Issue Templates with Dependency Field**

```yaml
# .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/agent-task.yml
- type: input
  id: blocked_by
  attributes:
    label: Blocked By
    description: Issue numbers that must be closed first (comma-separated)
    placeholder: "45, 46"

- type: input
  id: blocks
  attributes:
    label: Blocks
    description: Issue numbers that depend on this (comma-separated)
    placeholder: "47, 48"
```

**Pros:**
- Structured data entry
- Easy to parse
- No manual label management

**Cons:**
- Users can still skip/misenter data
- Needs validation workflow
- No automatic graph generation

---

**Option D: External Dependency Tracker (JSON file)**

```json
// .github/issue-dependencies.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "45": [],
    "46": ["45"],
    "47": ["46"],
    "48": ["45", "46"]
  }
}
```

```yaml
# Workflow validates against this file
- name: Validate dependencies
  run: python scripts/validate_issue_dependencies.py $ISSUE_NUM
```

**Pros:**
- Central source of truth
- Easy to query/visualize
- Version controlled

**Cons:**
- Manual file updates (error-prone)
- Gets out of sync with issues
- Requires custom tooling

---

### Recommended Solution: Hybrid Approach

**Phase 1: Issue Template + Label-Based Blocking**

1. Add dependency fields to issue templates
2. Bot auto-adds `blocked-by:#XX` labels from template
3. Workflow validates blockers before assignment
4. Workflow adds `status:blocked` label if blockers exist

**Phase 2: Automated Dependency Extraction**

1. Parse issue body for `Blocked By: #45, #46`
2. Create bidirectional links in issue comments
3. Bot updates `status:blocked` ‚Üí `status:ready` when blockers close

**Phase 3: Visual Dependency Graph**

1. Generate dependency graph from issue metadata
2. Commit to `docs/status/issue-dependencies.dot`
3. Render as SVG in README

**Estimated Effort:** 
- Phase 1: 4-6 hours
- Phase 2: 8-10 hours
- Phase 3: 4-6 hours

---

## Problem #3: Stalled PR Cleanup Doesn't Handle Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Current Behavior in `cleanup-stalled-prs.yml`

```yaml
if [ -n "$ISSUE_NUM" ]; then
  # Calls cleanup_recreate_issue.py
  # 1. Closes the PR
  # 2. Deletes the branch
  # 3. CLOSES THE ORIGINAL ISSUE  ‚ùå
  # 4. CREATES A NEW ISSUE        ‚ùå
  # 5. Re-assigns to Copilot
else
  # Just closes PR and deletes branch
  # Leaves original issue OPEN with no PR  ‚ùå
fi
```

### Problems

**Scenario A: Issue Found**
1. ‚ùå **Closes original issue** (loses history, comments, context)
2. ‚ùå **Creates duplicate issue** (breaks dependency tracking)
3. ‚ùå **Re-assigns to Copilot** (might fail again for same reason)

**Scenario B: No Issue Found**
1. ‚ùå **Orphaned work** (PR closed, but issue still open)
2. ‚ùå **Status desync** (issue shows "In Progress" but PR is gone)
3. ‚ùå **Manual cleanup required** (someone has to close the issue)

### What Should Happen

**Scenario A: Issue Found (Preferred Flow)**

1. ‚úÖ Close the stalled PR
2. ‚úÖ Delete the branch
3. ‚úÖ **KEEP the original issue open**
4. ‚úÖ **Add comment to issue:**
   ```
   Previous PR #123 was closed due to inactivity (48h stalled).
   
   Branch: copilot/rfc-0007-ecs-integration
   Reason: CI failed, no updates for 48 hours
   
   This issue remains open. Next steps:
   - Review failure logs: [link]
   - Consider if issue needs splitting
   - Re-assign to agent when ready
   ```
5. ‚úÖ **Remove assignee** (don't auto-reassign)
6. ‚úÖ **Add label:** `stalled-pr-cleanup`, `needs-investigation`

**Scenario B: No Issue Found**

1. ‚úÖ Close the stalled PR
2. ‚úÖ Delete the branch
3. ‚úÖ Add comment:
   ```
   Auto-closed: No linked issue found, stalled for 48h.
   
   If this PR should be reopened, please:
   1. Create or link an issue
   2. Add `Closes #<issue>` to PR body
   3. Investigate why PR stalled
   ```

### Why Don't Recreate Issues?

**Problems with recreation:**

1. **Loses context** - Comments, discussion, history gone
2. **Breaks dependencies** - Issue #46 blocked by #45, but #45 is now #52
3. **Confuses agents** - Different issue numbers, same task
4. **Audit trail loss** - Can't track why work failed
5. **GitHub limitations** - PRs can't be deleted, only closed

**Better approach:** Keep issues open, learn from failures

---

## Problem #4: Multi-Agent Coordination (Hidden Issue)

### The Real Problem

WingedBean uses **three different agents** with different strengths:

| Agent | Best For | Workflow |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **GitHub Copilot** | Small, incremental tasks | Issue ‚Üí PR ‚Üí Merge |
| **Claude Code** | Deep analysis, refactoring | Interactive, multi-file |
| **Windsurf** | Context-aware editing | Real-time assistance |

**Current workflow assumptions:**
- ‚ùå Only one agent works on the repo
- ‚ùå All work is PR-based
- ‚ùå Sequential task execution

**Reality:**
- ‚úÖ Multiple agents work in parallel
- ‚úÖ Claude/Windsurf don't always use PRs
- ‚úÖ Tasks have complex dependencies

### Example: RFC-0007 (Arch ECS Integration)

**Ideal work distribution:**

```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê

```

**Problems with current workflows:**
1. ‚ùå `assign-copilot-to-issue.yml` assumes only Copilot works
2. ‚ùå `auto-advance-micro.yml` assumes sequential Copilot PRs
3. ‚ùå No way to indicate "Issue #40 is for Claude, not Copilot"

### Solution: Agent-Aware Issue Management

**Option A: Issue Labels**

```yaml
labels:
  - rfc-0007
  - agent:claude-code      # Explicitly assign agent type
  - priority:high
  - status:ready
```

```yaml
# Workflow only assigns to Copilot if label matches
- name: Check agent assignment
  run: |
    LABELS=$(gh issue view $ISSUE_NUM --json labels -q '.labels[].name')
    if ! echo "$LABELS" | grep -q "agent:copilot"; then
      echo "Issue is not assigned to Copilot agent"
      exit 1
    fi
```

**Option B: Issue Templates by Agent**

```
.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ copilot-task.yml          # For incremental PRs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ claude-code-task.yml      # For architectural work
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ windsurf-task.yml         # For interactive editing
```

**Option C: Assignment Prefix**

```
Issue #40: [CLAUDE] Create ECS contracts
Issue #41: [COPILOT] Implement Arch plugin
Issue #42: [COPILOT] Create ECS game systems
Issue #43: [WINDSURF] Performance tuning
```

## Revised Recommendation: Foundational Work Required

### Phase 0: Prerequisites (Before Any Workflow Adoption)

**Must complete these foundational tasks:**

#### 1. Issue Dependency System (CRITICAL)

**Goal:** Prevent agents from working on blocked issues

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create issue template with dependency fields
- [ ] Create `validate-issue-dependencies.yml` workflow
- [ ] Add `blocked-by:#XX` label automation
- [ ] Document dependency conventions in PLAYBOOK.md

**Deliverables:**
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/agent-task.yml`
- `.github/workflows/validate-dependencies.yml`
- `docs/playbook/issue-dependency-management.md`

**Effort:** 6-8 hours  
**Priority:** P0 (CRITICAL)  
**Blocks:** All automation workflows

---

#### 2. Multi-Agent Issue Assignment (CRITICAL)

**Goal:** Different agents can work on appropriate tasks

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Define agent labels: `agent:copilot`, `agent:claude-code`, `agent:windsurf`
- [ ] Update issue templates with agent selection
- [ ] Modify `assign-copilot-to-issue.yml` to check labels
- [ ] Document agent selection criteria

**Deliverables:**
- Updated issue templates
- `docs/playbook/agent-selection-guide.md`
- Modified assignment workflows

**Effort:** 4-6 hours  
**Priority:** P0 (CRITICAL)  
**Blocks:** Any auto-assignment workflows

---

#### 3. Event-Driven Workflows Only (CRITICAL)

**Goal:** Zero cron jobs to minimize runner minutes

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Audit all proposed workflows for cron usage
- [ ] Convert polling to event-driven triggers
- [ ] Document event-driven patterns
- [ ] Set up runner minute monitoring

**Deliverables:**
- `docs/playbook/event-driven-workflows.md`
- Runner usage dashboard/badge

**Effort:** 2-3 hours  
**Priority:** P0 (CRITICAL)  
**Blocks:** Any workflow adoption

---

#### 4. Stalled PR Recovery (HIGH)

**Goal:** Clean up stalled PRs without losing issue context

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `stalled-pr-recovery.yml` workflow
- [ ] Never recreate issues (keep original)
- [ ] Add detailed failure comments
- [ ] Remove assignee, add investigation labels
- [ ] Document manual recovery process

**Deliverables:**
- `.github/workflows/stalled-pr-recovery.yml`
- `docs/playbook/stalled-pr-recovery.md`

**Effort:** 4-5 hours  
**Priority:** P1 (HIGH)  
**Depends:** Phase 0.1, 0.2

---

### Phase 1: Minimal Safe Automation (After Phase 0)

Only adopt workflows that:
- ‚úÖ Are event-driven (no cron)
- ‚úÖ Support multi-agent coordination
- ‚úÖ Respect issue dependencies
- ‚úÖ Don't recreate/delete issues

**Candidate Workflows:**

1. ‚úÖ `pr-enforce-issue-link.yml` (SAFE - no dependencies)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è `assign-copilot-to-issue.yml` (NEEDS REFACTORING - must check dependencies and agent labels)
3. ‚ùå `cleanup-stalled-prs.yml` (NEEDS COMPLETE REWRITE - see Phase 0.4)

---

### Phase 2: Advanced Automation (Future)

**Only after:**
- Phase 0 complete (all prerequisites)
- Phase 1 validated (no issues for 2+ weeks)
- Runner minute usage < 500 min/month
- Dependency system proven effective

---

## Runner Minute Budget Planning

### Conservative Approach

**Goal:** Stay under 500 minutes/month

| Workflow | Trigger | Est. Runs/Month | Min/Run | Total |
|----------|---------|-----------------|---------|-------|
| `pr-enforce-issue-link.yml` | PR opened/sync | ~50 | 0.5 | 25 |
| `validate-dependencies.yml` | Issue assigned | ~30 | 1 | 30 |
| `stalled-pr-recovery.yml` | Daily (manual) | ~4 | 2 | 8 |
| CI/CD (existing) | PR/push | ~100 | 3 | 300 |
| **Total** | | | | **363** |

**Buffer:** 137 minutes/month for unexpected runs

**Cost:** $0 (within free tier 2,000 min/month)

---

## Comparison: Event-Driven vs. Polling

### Anti-Pattern (ithome-ironman-2025)

```yaml
# Runs every 5 minutes looking for work
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/5 * * * *'

jobs:
  check_for_work:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check if there's anything to do
        run: |
          # 99% of the time, this finds nothing
          # But still costs 1 minute of runner time
```

**Cost:** 288 runs/day √ó 1 min = 8,640 min/month = $69/month (per workflow!)

---

### Correct Pattern (WingedBean)

```yaml
# Only runs when actual event occurs
on:
  issues:
    types: [assigned]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  handle_event:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Process the event
        run: |
          # Only runs when needed
```

**Cost:** ~30 runs/month √ó 1 min = 30 min/month = $0 (free tier)

**Savings:** $69/month per workflow

---

## Decision Matrix: What to Build vs. What to Adopt

| Component | Build Custom | Adopt from Ref | Rationale |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| Issue dependency validation | ‚úÖ Build | ‚ùå Not in ref | Core requirement, ref doesn't have |
| Multi-agent assignment | ‚úÖ Build | ‚ùå Not in ref | WingedBean-specific need |
| PR issue link enforcement | ‚ö†Ô∏è Adapt | ‚úÖ Can adopt | Simple, but needs minor tweaks |
| Stalled PR recovery | ‚úÖ Build | ‚ùå Ref is broken | Ref recreates issues (bad design) |
| Auto-advance workflow | ‚ùå Don't need | ‚ùå Don't adopt | Assumes micro-issues |
| RFC automation | ‚ùå Don't need | ‚ùå Don't adopt | Notion-specific |
| Auto-merge | ‚ùå Never | ‚ùå Never | Security violation |

---

## Open Questions for Team Discussion

### Question 1: Issue Numbering Strategy

**Context:** If we adopt micro-issues (RFC-0007-01, RFC-0007-02), dependencies are clearer but creates more issues.

**Options:**
- **A:** Keep monolithic RFCs (current approach)
  - Pros: Fewer issues, less overhead
  - Cons: Harder to assign incremental work
  
- **B:** Adopt micro-issues
  - Pros: Better granularity, clearer dependencies
  - Cons: More issues to manage, needs tooling

**Decision Needed:** Which approach for WingedBean?

---

### Question 2: GitHub Projects vs. Labels

**Context:** Dependencies can be tracked in GitHub Projects (visual graph) or labels (automation-friendly).

**Options:**
- **A:** GitHub Projects
  - Pros: Visual, native GitHub feature
  - Cons: Manual setup, no automated enforcement
  
- **B:** Label-based system
  - Pros: Automatable, version controlled
  - Cons: No visual graph, brittle parsing

**Decision Needed:** Which system to use?

---

### Question 3: Stalled PR Timeout

**Context:** How long should a PR be inactive before cleanup?

**Options:**
- **A:** 24 hours (aggressive)
- **B:** 48 hours (balanced)
- **C:** 72 hours (conservative)

**Recommendation:** Start with 72h, adjust based on data

---

### Question 4: Agent Assignment Automation

**Context:** Should assignment be fully automated or require human approval?

**Options:**
- **A:** Fully automated (if dependencies satisfied)
- **B:** Human approval required
- **C:** Hybrid (auto for P2/P3, manual for P0/P1)

**Recommendation:** Option C (hybrid approach)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. ‚úÖ **Review this analysis** with team
2. ‚úÖ **Decide on:** Issue numbering strategy (Q1)
3. ‚úÖ **Decide on:** Dependency tracking approach (Q2)
4. ‚è∏Ô∏è **Pause all workflow adoption** until Phase 0 complete

### Phase 0 Implementation (Week 1-2)

1. Implement issue dependency system
2. Implement multi-agent assignment
3. Document event-driven patterns
4. Create stalled PR recovery workflow

**Estimated Total Effort:** 16-22 hours

### Phase 1 Adoption (Week 3-4)

1. Adopt `pr-enforce-issue-link.yml`
2. Test dependency validation
3. Monitor runner minute usage
4. Iterate based on feedback

## Appendix A: Runner Minute Cost Calculator

```python

**Resulting Issue:**

```markdown
## Issue #46: Implement save manager

**Blocked By:** #45 (ECS state serialization design)
**Blocks:** #47 (Load UI), #48 (Save UI)
**Agent:** GitHub Copilot

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] SaveManager class implements ISaveService
- [ ] Tests pass (95%+ coverage)
- [ ] Integration with ECS world state
```

**Validation Workflow:**

```yaml
- name: Validate dependencies
  run: |
    BLOCKED_BY=$(gh issue view $ISSUE_NUM --json body -q .body | grep -oP 'Blocked By:.*?#\K\d+')
    
    for dep in $BLOCKED_BY; do
      STATE=$(gh issue view $dep --json state -q .state)
      if [ "$STATE" != "closed" ]; then
        echo "ERROR: Issue #$dep must be closed before #$ISSUE_NUM can be worked"
        gh issue edit $ISSUE_NUM --add-label "status:blocked"
        exit 1
      fi
    done
    
    gh issue edit $ISSUE_NUM --remove-label "status:blocked"
    gh issue edit $ISSUE_NUM --add-label "status:ready"
```
