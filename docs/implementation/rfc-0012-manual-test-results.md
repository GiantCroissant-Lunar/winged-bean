**Status:** COMPLETED WITH FINDINGS  

---

## Executive Summary

**Tests Executed:** 3/8 (37.5%)  
**Tests Passed:** 1/3 (33%)  
**Tests Failed:** 2/3 (67%)  
**Critical Issues Found:** 3  

### Key Findings

2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partial label automation** - Priority labels work, others fail (Test MT-002)
3. ‚ùå **Dependency validation fails** - Regex parsing issue + missing labels (Test MT-005)

---

## Test Results

### Test MT-001: Issue Template Creation ‚úÖ PASS

**Status:** ‚úÖ PASS  
**Date:** 2025-10-02 15:00  

**Objective:** Verify agent-task template creates properly formatted issues

**Test Data:**
- Title: "Test: Issue with Blocker (Dependency Validation)"
- RFC Reference: RFC-0012
- Blocked By: 999
- Assigned Agent: Copilot
- Priority: P3 (Low)

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ Issue created successfully: https://github.com/GiantCroissant-Lunar/winged-bean/issues/190
- ‚úÖ All fields appear in issue body
- ‚úÖ Formatting is clean and readable
- ‚úÖ Issue number assigned: #190

**Verdict:** **PASS** - Template works as expected

---

### Test MT-002: Auto-Labeling Workflow ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL PASS

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL PASS  
**Date:** 2025-10-02 15:02  

**Objective:** Verify auto-label-issues.yml extracts and applies labels

**Expected Labels:**
- agent:copilot (from "Assigned Agent: Copilot")
- priority:low (from "Priority: P3")  
- rfc-0012 (from "RFC Reference: RFC-0012")
- NO has-blockers (checking logic)

**Actual Labels Applied:**
- ‚úÖ priority:low ‚Üê **WORKS!**
- ‚ùå agent:copilot ‚Üê **MISSING**
- ‚ùå rfc-0012 ‚Üê **MISSING**
- ‚ùå has-blockers ‚Üê **MISSING** (should be added for "Blocked By: 999")

**Workflow Run:** https://github.com/GiantCroissant-Lunar/winged-bean/actions/runs/18185853339  
**Conclusion:** failure  

**Root Cause Analysis:**

1. **Priority label works** because it was already on GitHub
2. **Agent label fails** - Workflow parsing issue or label timing
3. **RFC label fails** - Case sensitivity? ("RFC-0012" vs "rfc-0012")
4. **has-blockers fails** - Blocker detection logic not working

**Evidence:**
```
# Issue body contains:
**Blocked By:** 999
**Assigned Agent:** Copilot
**RFC Reference:** RFC-0012
**Priority:** P3 (Low - test issue)

# Only applied:
priority:low
```

**Verdict:** **PARTIAL PASS** - Priority labeling works, but agent/RFC/blocker detection fails

---

### Test MT-003: PR Validation - Create PR ‚ùå BLOCKED

**Status:** ‚ùå BLOCKED  
**Date:** 2025-10-02 15:05  

**Objective:** Create test PR to verify pr-enforce-issue-link.yml blocks PRs without issue links

**Actions Taken:**
1. Created branch: test/rfc-0012-pr-validation
2. Added test line to README.md
3. Committed changes
4. Attempted to push to GitHub

**Error:**
```
pull request create failed: GraphQL: Head sha can't be blank, 
Base sha can't be blank, No commits between main and 
test/rfc-0012-pr-validation, Head ref must be a branch (createPullRequest)
```

**Root Cause:**
- Branch created locally
- Commit made locally  
- Push command completed
- But GitHub doesn't see the branch/commits
- Possible race condition or auth issue

**Verdict:** **BLOCKED** - Cannot test PR validation without working PR creation

---

### Test MT-005: Dependency Validation ‚ùå FAIL

**Status:** ‚ùå FAIL  
**Date:** 2025-10-02 15:02  

**Objective:** Verify validate-dependencies.yml detects and labels blocked issues

**Test Data:**
- Issue #190
- Blocked By: 999 (non-existent issue)
- Expected: status:blocked label + comment

**Results:**
- ‚ùå Workflow FAILED
- ‚ùå NO status:blocked label applied
- ‚ùå NO comment posted
- ‚úÖ Workflow triggered correctly

**Workflow Run:** https://github.com/GiantCroissant-Lunar/winged-bean/actions/runs/18185988969  
**Conclusion:** failure  

**Error Log:**
```
Error running gh command: failed to update 
https://github.com/GiantCroissant-Lunar/winged-bean/issues/190: 
'status:blocked' not found
failed to update 1 issue

Error running gh command: failed to update 
https://github.com/GiantCroissant-Lunar/winged-bean/issues/190: 
'status:ready' not found
failed to update 1 issue

subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '['gh', 'issue', 'edit', '190', 
'--add-label', 'status:ready']' returned non-zero exit status 1.
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**

1. **Labels don't exist on GitHub** (timing issue)
   - Labels created locally
   - Workflow ran before labels were synced
   - gh label create succeeded, but labels not available immediately

2. **Blocker detection logic issue**
   - Log says: "‚úì Issue #190 has no blockers"
   - But issue body has: "**Blocked By:** 999"
   - Regex not matching the format!

**Evidence:**
```python
# Script output:
‚úì Issue #190 has no blockers

# Issue body:
**Blocked By:** 999

# Regex in code:
pattern = r"Blocked By:.*"

# Problem: "**Blocked By:**" has ** markdown bold markers!
```

**Verdict:** **FAIL** - Two critical bugs:
1. Label creation timing issue
2. Regex doesn't handle markdown bold (`**`)

---

## Critical Issues Found

### Issue 1: Markdown Bold Breaks Regex Parsing

**Severity:** üî¥ HIGH  
**Impact:** Blocker detection doesn't work  

**Problem:**
```python
# Current regex:
pattern = r"Blocked By:.*"

# Doesn't match:
**Blocked By:** 999

# Because "Blocked By:" != "**Blocked By:**"
```

**Solution:**
```python
# Fix regex to handle markdown:
pattern = r"\*\*Blocked By:\*\*.*"
# OR more robust:
pattern = r"(?:\*\*)?Blocked By:(?:\*\*)?.*"
```

**Location:** `development/python/src/scripts/workflows/validate_issue_dependencies.py:32`

---

### Issue 2: Label Creation Timing

**Severity:** üü° MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Workflows fail on first run until labels propagate  

**Problem:**
- gh label create succeeds
- But label not immediately available for gh issue edit
- Causes workflow to fail with "label not found"

**Solution:**
1. Add retry logic with exponential backoff
2. OR: Create labels in repo setup (not during workflow)
3. OR: Make label operations graceful (try/except)

**Location:** All workflows that add labels

---

### Issue 3: Agent Label Parsing

**Severity:** üü° MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Agent assignment doesn't work  

**Problem:**
- Workflow checks for "Assigned Agent.*Copilot"
- Issue body has "**Assigned Agent:** Copilot"
- Regex should match, but doesn't apply label

**Possible Causes:**
1. Markdown bold markers (like Issue 1)
2. Workflow parsing uses grep, not proper regex
3. Case sensitivity issues

**Solution:**
- Debug auto-label-issues.yml workflow
- Add logging to see what's being matched
- Fix regex patterns

**Location:** `.github/workflows/auto-label-issues.yml`

---

## Tests Not Executed

Due to blocking issues, these tests were not completed:

- ‚è≥ **MT-004:** PR validation - Accept with issue link (blocked by MT-003)
- ‚è≥ **MT-006:** Pre-commit hook - Block commit (needs blocked issue)
- ‚è≥ **MT-007:** Pre-commit hook - Allow commit (needs ready issue)
- ‚è≥ **MT-008:** Agent auto-retry (requires natural CI failure)

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Fix blocking issues)

1. **Fix blocker regex** (Issue 1)
   ```python
   # Update validate_issue_dependencies.py
   pattern = r"(?:\*\*)?Blocked By:(?:\*\*)?.*"
   ```

2. **Fix agent label regex** (Issue 3)
   ```yaml
   # Update auto-label-issues.yml
   # Change from grep to Python regex
   # Handle markdown bold markers
   ```

3. **Add label retry logic** (Issue 2)
   ```python
   def add_label_with_retry(issue, label, max_attempts=3):
       for attempt in range(max_attempts):
           try:
               gh issue edit $issue --add-label $label
               return
           except:
               sleep(2 ** attempt)
       raise
   ```

### Short-term (Complete testing)

4. **Debug PR creation issue**
   - Check git push logs
   - Verify branch exists on GitHub
   - Try creating PR via GitHub UI

5. **Re-run tests after fixes**
   - MT-002: Auto-labeling (with fixed regex)
   - MT-003: PR validation (with working push)
   - MT-005: Dependency validation (with fixed regex)

6. **Complete remaining tests**
   - MT-006, MT-007: Pre-commit hook
   - MT-008: Agent auto-retry (observation)

### Long-term (Prevent future issues)

7. **Add integration tests**
   - Test regex patterns with various markdown formats
   - Mock gh commands
   - Verify label operations

8. **Improve error handling**
   - Graceful degradation if labels missing
   - Better error messages
   - Retry logic for transient failures

9. **Add workflow logging**
   - Echo parsed values
   - Show what regex matched
   - Debug output for troubleshooting
