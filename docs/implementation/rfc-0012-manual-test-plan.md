## Test 8: Agent Auto-Retry (Observation Only)

**Test ID:** MT-008  
**Objective:** Verify agent-auto-retry.yml triggers on CI failure

**Note:** This test requires a natural CI failure or intentional failure. We'll observe in production.

### Procedure (When Failure Occurs)

1. Wait for a natural CI failure (MegaLinter, Qodana, etc.)
2. Observe agent-auto-retry workflow
3. Check if:
   - Workflow detects failure
   - Posts logs to linked issue
   - Adds retry label (ci-failed-retry-1)
   - Closes PR
   - Deletes branch (optional)

### Expected Results

- ‚úì Workflow triggers within 1 minute of failure

- [ ] Close test PR (MT-003)
- [ ] Close test issue (MT-005 - blocked issue)
- [ ] Keep Phase 2 issue (MT-001) as real tracking issue
- [ ] Delete test branches
- [ ] Update validation report with results
- [ ] Commit test plan with results

---

## Success Criteria

**All tests pass when:**
- Issue template works correctly
- Auto-labeling applies correct labels
- PR validation enforces issue links
- Dependency validation detects blockers
- Pre-commit hook blocks/allows appropriately
- Agent auto-retry observed (or tested manually)
