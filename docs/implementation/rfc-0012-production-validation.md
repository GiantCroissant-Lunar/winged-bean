# RFC-0012 Production Validation Report

**Date:** 2025-10-02  
**Validator:** GitHub Copilot  
**Status:** In Progress  

---

## Validation Objectives

Test RFC-0012 automation workflows in production environment to verify:
1. ✅ Issue template works correctly
2. ⏳ Auto-labeling workflow triggers
3. ⏳ PR validation workflow enforces issue links
4. ⏳ Dependency validation workflow detects blockers
5. ⏳ Runner minute monitoring provides accurate data
6. ⏳ Pre-commit hook blocks commits on blocked issues

---

## Test 1: Issue Template Creation

**Objective:** Verify agent-task template creates properly formatted issues

**Procedure:**
1. Navigate to: https://github.com/GiantCroissant-Lunar/winged-bean/issues/new/choose
2. Select "Agent Task" template
3. Fill out all fields
4. Create issue

**Expected Results:**
- All fields populate correctly in issue body
- Issue is created successfully
- Manual labels are applied (agent-task, rfc-0012, priority:high)

**Actual Results:**
- ✅ Issue created: #TBD "RFC-0012-02: Implement Phase 2 Advanced Features"
- ✅ Template fields properly formatted
- ✅ RFC reference, summary, acceptance criteria present
- ✅ Blocked By, Blocks, Agent fields present
- ✅ Manual labels applied

**Status:** ✅ PASS

---

## Test 2: Auto-Labeling Workflow

**Objective:** Verify auto-label-issues.yml adds labels based on issue content

**Procedure:**
1. Create issue with agent-task template
2. Wait for auto-label workflow to trigger
3. Check issue labels

**Expected Results:**
- `agent:claude-code` label added (from "Assigned Agent: Claude Code")
- `priority:high` label added (from "Priority: P1")
- `rfc-0012` label added (from "RFC Reference: RFC-0012")
- No `has-blockers` label (Blocked By: None)

**Actual Results:**
- ⏳ Waiting for workflow to run (~30 seconds)
- Check: https://github.com/GiantCroissant-Lunar/winged-bean/actions

**Status:** ⏳ IN PROGRESS

---

## Test 3: Runner Minute Monitoring

**Objective:** Verify monitoring script provides accurate usage data

**Procedure:**
1. Run: `python -m scripts.workflows.monitor_runner_usage`
2. Review output
3. Compare with GitHub Actions usage page

**Expected Results:**
- Script fetches runs from last 7 days
- Estimates usage by workflow
- Projects monthly usage
- Shows budget status (< 500 min target)

**Actual Results:**
```
GitHub Actions Runner Minute Monitor

Total Minutes: X

By Workflow:
  [Workflow data]

Projected Monthly Usage: X minutes

Budget Analysis:
  Target Budget: 500 min/month
  Free Tier: 2000 min/month
  Projected: X min/month
  Status: ✓ Under budget
```

**Status:** ⏳ TESTING

---

## Test 4: PR Issue Link Enforcement

**Objective:** Verify PR validation fails without issue link

**Procedure:**
1. Create test branch
2. Make trivial change
3. Create PR without "Closes #" in description
4. Observe workflow failure

**Expected Results:**
- Workflow: pr-enforce-issue-link.yml triggers
- Workflow fails with clear error message
- PR shows red X status
- Error indicates missing issue link

**Actual Results:**
- ⏳ Not yet tested (requires PR creation)

**Status:** ⏳ PENDING

---

## Test 5: Dependency Validation

**Objective:** Verify dependency validation detects blockers

**Procedure:**
1. Create issue with "Blocked By: #999" (non-existent issue)
2. Wait for validate-dependencies workflow
3. Check for `status:blocked` label

**Expected Results:**
- Workflow: validate-dependencies.yml triggers
- Issue gets `status:blocked` label
- Comment posted explaining blockers
- Lists blocker issues

**Actual Results:**
- ⏳ Not yet tested

**Status:** ⏳ PENDING

---

## Test 6: Pre-Commit Hook

**Objective:** Verify pre-commit hook blocks commits on blocked issues

**Procedure:**
1. Create issue with blockers
2. Reference issue in commit message
3. Attempt to commit
4. Verify commit is blocked

**Expected Results:**
- Pre-commit hook runs validate_issue_dependencies.py
- Detects open blockers
- Blocks commit with clear error message
- Lists which blockers must be closed first

**Actual Results:**
- ⏳ Not yet tested

**Status:** ⏳ PENDING

---

## Test 7: Agent Auto-Retry

**Objective:** Verify agent auto-retry workflow handles CI failures

**Procedure:**
1. Wait for natural CI failure OR
2. Create intentional failure (bad code)
3. Observe agent-auto-retry workflow
4. Verify retry behavior

**Expected Results:**
- Workflow: agent-auto-retry.yml triggers on failure
- Failure logs posted to issue
- PR closed and branch deleted
- Retry label added (ci-failed-retry-1)
- After 3 failures, escalates to human

**Actual Results:**
- ⏳ Waiting for CI failure to occur naturally

**Status:** ⏳ PENDING (requires CI failure)
