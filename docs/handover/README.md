## When to Create Handover Docs

Create handover documentation when:

1. **Team transitions** - New team members joining or leaving
2. **Project handoff** - Transferring ownership to another team
3. **Milestone completion** - Documenting state at major milestones
4. **Long breaks** - Before extended project pauses
5. **Stakeholder changes** - New stakeholders need context

---

## Naming Conventions

**Format**: Descriptive names indicating the handover type and date

**Examples**:
- `project-handover-2025-10-02.md`
- `onboarding-guide-developers.md`
- `q4-2025-project-state.md`
- `context-plugin-architecture-evolution.md`

---

## Lifecycle

### Creation
- Created for specific handover events
- Captures point-in-time state
- Includes both current state and historical context

### Maintenance
- Update onboarding guides as project evolves
- Project handover docs are typically point-in-time snapshots
- Archive old handovers when superseded

### Archival
Move to `.archive/handover/YYYY/` when:
- Handover complete and information integrated elsewhere
- Onboarding guide superseded by newer version
- Project state documentation no longer relevant
