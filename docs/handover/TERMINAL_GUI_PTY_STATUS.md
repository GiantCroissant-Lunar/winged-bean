# Terminal.Gui PTY Integration - Current Status

**Date:** 2025-10-01

## ‚úÖ VERIFIED: Terminal.Gui Works in PTY

**Test Results:**
```
PTY process spawned successfully
Data frames received: 226
Terminal.Gui sent data to PTY: SUCCESS
```

**Diagnostic Test:** `development/nodejs/pty-service/test-terminal-gui-direct.js`

This **proves** that:
1. ‚úÖ .NET 8 runtime is working
2. ‚úÖ Terminal.Gui v2 initializes correctly
3. ‚úÖ PTY environment is configured properly
4. ‚úÖ Terminal.Gui sends ANSI escape sequences to PTY
5. ‚úÖ 226 data frames = substantial output (Terminal.Gui is rendering)

## ‚ùå ISSUE: WebSocket Connection Unstable

**Problem:**
The browser WebSocket disconnects after ~6 seconds with code 1001 ("going away").

**Evidence:**
```
PTY logs:
  WebSocket client connected
  PTY process spawned with PID: 57370
  [6 seconds pass]
  WebSocket client disconnected: 1001
  Killing PTY process...
  PTY process exited with code 0, signal 1
```

**Root Cause:**
The issue is **NOT** with Terminal.Gui or PTY. The issue is with the **WebSocket connection** between the browser and PTY service.

Possible causes:
1. xterm.js timeout or error
2. Browser navigation/reload
3. JavaScript error in XTerm.astro
4. WebSocket protocol mismatch
5. Data not being sent fast enough to keep connection alive

## üîç What We Know

### Working Components ‚úÖ
- [x] PM2 services (pty-service, docs-site)
- [x] .NET 8 SDK and runtime installed
- [x] Terminal.Gui v2 application builds
- [x] PTY spawns .NET process successfully
- [x] Terminal.Gui renders in PTY (226 frames)
- [x] WebSocket server accepts connections
- [x] Playwright test infrastructure
- [x] Asciinema recording capability

### Broken Components ‚ùå
- [ ] WebSocket connection stability (disconnects after 6s)
- [ ] Browser receives Terminal.Gui output
- [ ] xterm.js displays Terminal.Gui UI

---

## üéØ Next Steps to Fix

### 1. Check XTerm.astro WebSocket Handling
**File:** `development/nodejs/sites/docs/src/components/XTerm.astro`

Look for:
- Timeout settings
- Error handlers
- Connection close logic
- Binary data handling

### 2. Add WebSocket Debugging
Add console logging to see:
- When WebSocket connects
- How much data is received
- Why it disconnects
- Any JavaScript errors

### 3. Test WebSocket Connection Directly
Create a simple WebSocket client to test:
```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:4041');
ws.binaryType = 'arraybuffer';
ws.onmessage = (e) => console.log('Data:', e.data);
ws.onclose = (e) => console.log('Closed:', e.code, e.reason);
```

### 4. Check Browser Console
Open browser dev tools and check for:
- JavaScript errors
- WebSocket connection status
- Network tab for WebSocket frames

## üìä RFC-0008 Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Playwright Setup** - Fully operational
   - `@playwright/test@1.55.1` installed
   - Chromium browser configured
   - Test infrastructure working
   - Screenshots captured successfully

2. **Asciinema Setup** - Fully operational
   - `asciinema@3.0.0` installed
   - Recording script created
   - `docs/recordings/` directory ready

3. **Test Infrastructure** - Working
   - `playwright.config.js` configured
   - E2E tests running
   - Background process execution working
   - Screenshot capture working

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Blocked
1. **Visual Verification** - Blocked by WebSocket issue
   - Can't verify Terminal.Gui UI in browser
   - Screenshots only show connection messages
   - Need stable WebSocket connection

2. **Baseline Recording** - Blocked by WebSocket issue
   - Can't record Terminal.Gui session via browser
   - Direct recording works; prefer running from artifacts (`task console:normal`)
   - Need browser integration working

## üîß Diagnostic Commands

### Test Terminal.Gui in PTY Directly
```bash
cd development/nodejs/pty-service
node test-terminal-gui-direct.js
```

### Check PM2 Logs
```bash
pm2 logs pty-service --lines 50
```

### Test .NET App Directly
```bash
cd development/dotnet/console
cd build && task build-all && task console:normal
```

### Run Playwright Tests
```bash
cd development/nodejs
pnpm test:e2e
```

### Check WebSocket Connection
```bash
# Open browser console at http://localhost:4321
# Check Network tab -> WS (WebSocket)
# Look for connection to ws://localhost:4041
```

## üìù Summary

**Good News:**
- Terminal.Gui v2 **IS WORKING** in PTY environment
- RFC-0008 infrastructure (Playwright + Asciinema) is **COMPLETE**
- All dependencies installed correctly
- Test framework operational

**Bad News:**
- WebSocket connection is **UNSTABLE** (disconnects after 6s)
- Browser never receives Terminal.Gui output
- Can't visually verify Terminal.Gui in browser yet

**Next Action:**
Fix the WebSocket connection stability issue in `XTerm.astro` or investigate why the browser is disconnecting.

**Status:** üü° **PARTIALLY WORKING**  
**Blocker:** WebSocket connection stability  
**Priority:** HIGH - This blocks visual verification and RFC-0008 completion
