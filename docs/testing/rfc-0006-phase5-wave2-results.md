# RFC-0006 Phase 5 Wave 2 Test Results

**Test Date:** 2025-10-02  
**Issue:** #56 - Verify dynamic plugin loading works at runtime  
**Phase:** 5 - Testing  
**Wave:** 5.2 (SERIAL)  
**Dependencies:** #55 (Build verification)

   - Version: 1.0.0
   - Status: Loaded successfully

2. ✅ `wingedbean.plugins.websocket` (priority: 100)
   - Version: 1.0.0
   - Status: Loaded successfully
   - Services: IWebSocketService registered

3. ✅ `wingedbean.plugins.terminalui` (priority: 100)
   - Version: 1.0.0
   - Status: Loaded successfully
   - Services: ITerminalUIService registered

4. ✅ `wingedbean.plugins.ptyservice` (priority: 90)
   - Version: 1.0.0
   - Status: Loaded successfully

5. ✅ `wingedbean.plugins.consoledungeon` (priority: 50)
   - Version: 1.0.0
   - Status: Loaded successfully

6. ⊘ `wingedbean.plugins.asciinemarecorder` (priority: 80, strategy: Lazy)
   - Status: Correctly skipped (lazy load strategy)

**Observations:**
- Plugins loaded in correct priority order (highest to lowest)
- Lazy loading strategy respected
- No plugin load failures
- All plugin dependencies resolved correctly

### ✅ Test 2: No Errors

**Result:** PASSED

- ✅ No fatal errors during initialization
- ✅ No exceptions during plugin loading
- ✅ No dependency resolution failures
- ✅ All plugins activated successfully
- ✅ Application launched without errors

**Error Log Analysis:**
```
❌ FATAL ERROR: (none)
✗ Failed to load: (none)
```

### ✅ Test 3: Services Available

**Result:** PASSED

**Foundation Services:**
- ✅ IRegistry - Registered and available
- ✅ IPluginLoader - Registered and available

**Plugin Services:**
- ✅ IWebSocketService - Registered at priority 100
- ✅ ITerminalUIService - Registered at priority 100

**Service Verification:**
- All required services retrieved successfully from registry
- WebSocket server started on port 4040
- TerminalUI initialized correctly
- No service resolution failures

## Success Criteria Verification

All success criteria from Issue #56 have been met:

### ✅ All plugins load
- 5 eager-load plugins loaded successfully
- 1 lazy-load plugin correctly skipped
- Plugins loaded in priority order
- No load failures

### ✅ No errors
- Zero fatal errors during initialization
- Zero exceptions during plugin loading
- Zero dependency resolution failures
- Application launched successfully

### ✅ Services available
- Foundation services (IRegistry, IPluginLoader) available
- Plugin services (IWebSocketService, ITerminalUIService) registered and working
- All services retrievable from registry
- Services functioning correctly (WebSocket server running, TerminalUI initialized)

## Technical Details

### Fixes Applied

Three key fixes were required to make dynamic plugin loading work:

1. **AssemblyContextProvider - Dependency Resolution**
   - Added `Resolving` event handler to AssemblyLoadContext
   - Probes plugin directory for dependency DLLs
   - Caches loaded dependencies for reuse
   - Fixes: "Could not load file or assembly 'WingedBean.Contracts.Config'" errors

2. **LoadedPluginWrapper - Service Discovery**
   - Added automatic service discovery in constructor
   - Finds all types implementing WingedBean.Contracts.* interfaces
   - Instantiates services with parameterless constructors
   - Populates `_services` dictionary for `GetServices()` method
   - Fixes: Services not being returned by `GetServices()`

3. **Program.cs - Reflection Disambiguation**
   - Fixed ambiguous method resolution for `IRegistry.Register<T>`
   - Uses specific parameter type matching (TService, int)
   - Avoids "Ambiguous match found" reflection errors
   - Fixes: Service registration failures

### Plugin Loading Architecture

The successful dynamic loading follows this flow:

```
plugins.json (config)
    ↓
ActualPluginLoader.LoadAsync(path)
    ↓
AssemblyContextProvider.LoadAssembly()
    ↓ (with dependency resolution)
LoadedPluginWrapper (with service discovery)
    ↓
Program.cs RegisterPluginServicesAsync()
    ↓
ActualRegistry.Register<T>()
    ↓
Services available via IRegistry.Get<T>()
```

## Conclusion

✅ **PHASE 5 WAVE 2 VERIFICATION COMPLETE**

Dynamic plugin loading is fully functional and meets all requirements:
- Plugins load from configuration at runtime
- No compile-time dependencies on plugin assemblies
- Services auto-register and are available through registry
- Error handling works correctly
- Lazy loading strategy respected
- Application runs successfully with dynamically loaded plugins

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed to Wave 5.3: xterm.js integration verification (#57)
- Monitor for any runtime issues with plugin hot-reload scenarios
- Consider adding integration tests for plugin loading
