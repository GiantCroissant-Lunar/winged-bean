### RFC-0017: Reactive Plugin Architecture for Dungeon Game
**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2025-10-03
**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Category:** gameplay, plugins

**Summary:** Separate ConsoleDungeon gameplay and UI concerns into dedicated plugins that communicate through reactive streams (System.Reactive, ReactiveUI, MessagePipe). Aligns the dungeon crawler experience with the four-tier architecture while enabling hot-swappable UIs.

**Key Actions:**
- Move Arch ECS gameplay systems into `WingedBean.Plugins.DungeonGame`
- Limit host responsibility to registry setup and plugin orchestration
- Provide `IDungeonGameService` observables for UI plugins

**Open Work:**
- Finalise reactive message contracts
- Update Terminal UI plugin to consume observables instead of direct ECS access

## Superseded RFCs

### RFC-0014: Engine Profile Abstraction
**Status:** Superseded by RFC-0017
**Date:** 2025-10-03

**Summary:** Explored adding an explicit `IEngineProfile` abstraction (inspired by craft-sim) to consolidate engine-specific conventions, build pipelines, and package management. Review concluded the four-tier structure already provides the necessary separation, so the proposal was not adopted.

**Resolution:** Capture profile-specific details in Tier 3/4 adapters and extend `IECSService` for multi-world + editor mode support instead of introducing a new profile registry.
