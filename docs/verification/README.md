# Verification Documentation

**Purpose**: RFC and feature verification documentation

---

## Overview

This directory contains verification reports that validate RFC implementations against their acceptance criteria. These documents provide formal sign-off that features are complete and working as designed.

### Key Characteristics
- **Criteria-focused** - Validates specific acceptance criteria from RFCs
- **Evidence-based** - Links to test results, demos, and artifacts
- **Sign-off records** - Formal approval documentation
- **Archivable** - Once verified, reports become historical records

## Document Types

### RFC Verification Reports
Validate that an RFC has been fully implemented according to its acceptance criteria

**Contains**:
- Executive summary (high-level pass/fail)
- Verification checklist (detailed task completion)
- Test results (build, runtime, automated tests)
- Success criteria assessment
- Regression analysis
- Risk assessment
- Conclusion and sign-off

---

### Feature Verification Reports
Validate specific features or components

**Contains**:
- Feature requirements validation
- Functional testing results
- Performance validation
- Security verification
- Integration testing results

---

## Report Format

Each verification report follows a standard structure:

1. **Executive Summary** - High-level pass/fail status
2. **Verification Checklist** - Detailed task completion
3. **Test Results** - Build, runtime, and automated test outcomes
4. **Success Criteria Assessment** - Criteria met/unmet
5. **Regression Analysis** - Impact assessment
6. **Risk Assessment** - Identified risks
7. **Conclusion** - Final status and sign-off

## Verification Workflow

### 1. Implementation Complete
- RFC marked as "Implemented" by development team
- All implementation tasks completed
- Initial testing done

### 2. Verification Planning
- Create verification document from template
- Identify evidence needed for each criterion
- Schedule verification activities

### 3. Evidence Gathering
- Run comprehensive test suites
- Generate test reports
- Create demos or recordings
- Document findings

### 4. Verification Execution
- Validate each acceptance criterion
- Document deviations or issues
- Assess production readiness
- Identify any blockers

### 5. Sign-Off
- Technical verification by engineering team
- Update RFC status
- Archive verification report

---

## Quality Gates

### Verification Approval Requires

1. ✅ **All acceptance criteria met** (or deviations approved)
2. ✅ **All critical/high severity issues resolved**
3. ✅ **Test coverage meets standards** (≥80%)
4. ✅ **Performance benchmarks met**
5. ✅ **Security review passed** (if applicable)
6. ✅ **Documentation complete**
7. ✅ **Regression analysis complete**

---

## Usage

### During Development
Create verification report as final step before marking RFC as "Implemented"

### In PR Reviews
Reference verification report as evidence of completion

### In CI/CD
Use automated scripts mentioned in reports for continuous verification

### For Audits
Provides traceability and compliance evidence

## Contributing

When adding a new verification report:
1. Follow the standard report template
2. Include all required sections
3. Document actual test results (not aspirational)
4. Update this README with a link to the report
5. Link verification report from RFC
