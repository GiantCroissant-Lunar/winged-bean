# 🎵 Audio Integration - Ready to Test!

## Build Status: ✅ Complete

Fresh end-to-end build completed successfully at 08:24:44 AM on 2025-10-11.

### Services Running
All PM2 services are online:
- ✅ **pty-service** (port 4041) - WebSocket for Terminal.Gui PTY
- ✅ **docs-site** (port 4321) - Astro dev server  
- ✅ **console-dungeon** (port 4040) - Game app WebSocket

### Audio Setup
- ✅ Audio plugin enabled in plugins.json
- ✅ Audio plugin loaded successfully (WingedBean.Plugins.Audio v1.0.0)
- ✅ LibVLC installed (VLC 3.0.21)
- ✅ Sound file ready: `movement-step.wav` (13KB, 200Hz tone, 0.15s duration)
- ✅ Sound file in artifacts: `_artifacts/latest/dotnet/assets/sounds/movement-step.wav`

### Code Changes
- ✅ TerminalGuiSceneProvider updated to use full file paths
- ✅ PlayMovementSound() method active with audio API calls
- ✅ Exception handling in place for graceful failure

## 🎮 How to Test

### Open the Demo
```
http://localhost:4321/demo/
```

### Test Movement Sounds
1. Wait for the PTY terminal to connect (you'll see the game interface)
2. Use arrow keys to move the player: ↑ ↓ ← →
3. **Listen for audio!** You should hear a subtle beep on each movement
4. Watch the console log for: `🔊 Moved north` (or south/east/west)

### Expected Behavior
- **Sound**: Short beep (200Hz, 0.15s) at 30% volume on each arrow key press
- **Visual**: Console log shows 🔊 icon with movement direction
- **F4 Key**: Opens audio info dialog showing audio service status

## 📝 What to Check

### If Audio Works
- ✅ You hear the beep sound when moving
- ✅ Console log shows 🔊 icons
- ✅ F4 dialog shows "Audio service available"

### If No Audio
Check the logs:
```bash
pm2 logs console-dungeon | grep -i "audio\|libvlc"
```

Possible reasons:
- LibVLC may not have initialized (check logs for initialization errors)
- Sound file path might be incorrect (check debug logs for file path)
- Audio plugin might have failed to load LibVLC libraries

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check PM2 status
pm2 list

# View console logs
pm2 logs console-dungeon --lines 50

# Check for LibVLC initialization
pm2 logs console-dungeon --nostream | grep -i libvlc

# Check sound file exists
ls -lh build/_artifacts/latest/dotnet/assets/sounds/
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Sound File
- **Location**: `build/_artifacts/latest/dotnet/assets/sounds/movement-step.wav`
- **Format**: WAV, 44.1kHz, mono, 16-bit PCM
- **Duration**: 0.15 seconds
- **Frequency**: 200Hz sine wave
- **Effects**: Volume 0.3, fade in 0.02s, fade out 0.05s

### Audio Path Construction
```csharp
var baseDir = AppContext.BaseDirectory;
var soundPath = Path.Combine(baseDir, "..", "..", "..", "..", "assets", "sounds", "movement-step.wav");
var fullPath = Path.GetFullPath(soundPath);
_audioService.Play(fullPath, new AudioPlayOptions { Volume = 0.3f, Loop = false });
```

### Plugin Loading
The Audio plugin is loaded at startup:
```
✓ Loaded: WingedBean.Plugins.Audio v1.0.0
✓ 2 plugins loaded successfully
```

## ⚠️ Known Issue

A `v0.0.1-410` directory is still being created during runtime (contains `pty/recordings/`). This is a separate issue from the AsciinemaRecorder fix and doesn't affect audio functionality. The recording system appears to have its own version path handling.

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the audio** - Try moving the player and see if you hear sounds!
2. **If it works**: Consider adding more sound effects (combat, items, doors, etc.)
3. **If it doesn't work**: Check the debug commands above and look for LibVLC errors
