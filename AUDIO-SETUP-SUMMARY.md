brew install --cask vlc
```

- LibVLC libraries available at `/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/lib/`

### 3. ✅ Created Sound File
**File:** `development/dotnet/console/assets/sounds/movement-step.wav`
- Generated using ffmpeg

### 4. ✅ Updated Code
**File:** `development/dotnet/console/src/plugins/WingedBean.Plugins.ConsoleDungeon/Scene/TerminalGuiSceneProvider.cs`

Changes:
- Added `using System.IO;`
- Updated `PlayMovementSound()` method to use full file path:
  ```csharp
  var baseDir = AppContext.BaseDirectory;
  var soundPath = Path.Combine(baseDir, "..", "..", "..", "..", "assets", "sounds", "movement-step.wav");
  var fullPath = Path.GetFullPath(soundPath);
  _audioService.Play(fullPath, new AudioPlayOptions { Volume = 0.3f, Loop = false });
  ```

### 5. ✅ Built & Deployed
- Build completed successfully (0 errors, 38 warnings)
- Sound file copied to `build/_artifacts/latest/dotnet/assets/sounds/`
