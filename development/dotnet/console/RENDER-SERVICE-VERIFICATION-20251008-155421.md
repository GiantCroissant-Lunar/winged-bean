# Render Service Verification Report

**Date**: $(date)
**Version**: 0.0.1-373
**Artifacts Path**: `build/_artifacts/latest/dotnet/bin/`

## Summary

✅ **RENDER SERVICE IS WORKING CORRECTLY**

The render service registration issue mentioned in the handover document is **RESOLVED**. The service registers successfully and the game runs without any abort messages.

## Evidence

### 1. Test Results
- **DungeonGamePluginTests**: ✅ PASSED
  - Test: `OnActivateAsync_RegistersRenderService_Simple`
  - Confirmed render service registration works with both real ArchECS and TestRegistry

### 2. Fresh Application Run (15:53:32 - Current Session)

Key log entries from fresh startup:

```
✓ IRenderService registered: RenderServiceProvider
[ConsoleDungeonApp] IRenderService ready (ASCII mode)
[ConsoleDungeonApp] Game initialized. State: Running
[ConsoleDungeonApp] Game update #1
[ConsoleDungeonApp] Game update #50
[ConsoleDungeonApp] Game update #100
```

### 3. Terminal UI Rendering
The Terminal.Gui interface is rendering correctly:
- Player character '@' visible at position (40, 12)
- Goblin enemies 'g' visible at multiple positions
- Status bar showing HP/MP/Level
- Game loop running continuously

### 4. No Error Messages
- ❌ No "IRenderService not registered" messages
- ❌ No "Abort: render service is null" messages  
- ❌ No service not found exceptions

### 5. PM2 Status
```
console-dungeon    │ online    │ 65.7mb   │ 2m uptime
Game update #1650 (and counting)
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The "issue" in the handover was likely due to:
1. **Stale artifacts** - The previous PM2 run was using artifacts built before the render service code was added
2. **Version confusion** - The handover mentioned it "worked once" at 15:01 but failed at 15:03, which was probably before/after a code change

## Current State

### Plugin Registration Flow
1. `DungeonGamePlugin.OnActivateAsync()` is called
2. Creates `RenderServiceProvider` instance
3. Registers with `registry.Register<Plate.CrossMilo.Contracts.Game.Render.IService>(_renderService)`
4. Host successfully retrieves with `_registry.Get<IRenderService>()` where `IRenderService` is a type alias for the same interface

### Type Matching
- Registration type: `Plate.CrossMilo.Contracts.Game.Render.IService`
- Retrieval type: `IRenderService` (alias for same type)
- Both resolve to identical `Type` objects in the registry dictionary

## Conclusion

The render service is **fully functional**. No code changes are needed. The system works correctly with:
- ✅ Plugin manifest exports
- ✅ Service registration in plugin
- ✅ Service retrieval in host
- ✅ Terminal.Gui rendering
- ✅ Game loop updates

**Next Steps**: Focus on other features or improvements rather than debugging this resolved issue.
