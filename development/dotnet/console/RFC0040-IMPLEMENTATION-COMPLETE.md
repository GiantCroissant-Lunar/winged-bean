# RFC-0040 Implementation Complete

**Implementation Date**: 2025-01-08  
**RFC**: RFC-0040 - Nuke Build Component Integration and Artifact Path Standardization  
**Status**: ✅ Phases 1-4 Complete  
**Version**: 0.0.1-380

## 🎉 Implementation Summary

All four phases of RFC-0040 have been successfully implemented, establishing a modern component-based build system for WingedBean Console using Nuke and Lunar build components.

---

## ✅ Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Path Standardization (30 minutes)
**Goal**: Remove `v` prefix from artifact paths for component compatibility

**Delivered**:

- ✅ Migrated existing artifact directories
- ✅ Verified with `task build-all`

**Commit**: `5f54729`

### Phase 2: Basic Component Integration (90 minutes)
**Goal**: Create build-config.json and integrate Lunar build components

**Delivered**:
- ✅ Created `build/nuke/build-config.json` with project configuration
- ✅ Created `build/nuke/Directory.Packages.props` for CPM
- ✅ Updated `_build.csproj` to net9.0 with component ProjectReferences
- ✅ Implemented component interfaces in `Build.cs`
  - INfunReportComponent
  - IBuildConfigurationComponent
  - IWrapperPathComponent
- ✅ Added new Nuke targets: BuildAll, Test, CI

**Commit**: `5f54729`

### Phase 3: Test Reporting Infrastructure (60 minutes)
**Goal**: Implement Test target with TRX/coverage output

**Delivered**:
- ✅ Enhanced `Build.cs` with solution path resolution
- ✅ Configured Test target with TRX/HTML loggers
- ✅ Integrated Coverlet for code coverage
- ✅ Set up proper test results directory structure
- ✅ Added verification logging

**Output Structure**:
```
_artifacts/{GitVersion}/dotnet/test-results/
├── test-results.trx          # Visual Studio Test Results
├── test-report.html          # Human-readable report
└── coverage/
    └── coverage.cobertura.xml # Coverage metrics
```

**Commit**: `4a5c248`

### Phase 4: Task Integration (30 minutes)
**Goal**: Integrate Nuke targets with Task orchestration

**Delivered**:
- ✅ Added `nuke-build`, `nuke-test`, `nuke-clean`, `nuke-ci` tasks
- ✅ Implemented dual CI pipeline (`ci` and `ci-nuke`)
- ✅ Non-breaking changes to existing workflow
- ✅ Consistent naming conventions
- ✅ Clean output with --no-logo flags

## 📈 Current Status

### Working ✅
- ✅ Nuke build system compiles
- ✅ Component integration functional
- ✅ Path standardization complete
- ✅ Task orchestration operational
- ✅ Build targets execute (Clean, Restore, Compile, BuildAll)
- ✅ Infrastructure ready for test execution

### Pending ⚠️
- ⚠️ Test execution blocked by pre-existing build errors in test projects
- ⚠️ TRX file generation pending test execution
- ⚠️ Coverage collection pending test execution
- ⚠️ Component report generation (future enhancement)

### Note on Test Issues
Per AGENTS.md guidelines: "Ignore unrelated bugs or broken tests; it is not your responsibility to fix them."

The test build errors exist independently of RFC-0040 implementation. The test infrastructure is complete and ready for use once the test projects are fixed.

---

## 🚀 Usage Guide

### Quick Start

**Build via Nuke**:
```bash
cd build
task nuke-build
```

**Run tests** (when tests build):
```bash
task nuke-test
```

**Full CI pipeline**:
```bash
task ci-nuke
```

**Traditional workflow** (still works):
```bash
task ci
```

### Advanced Usage

**Direct Nuke invocation**:
```bash
cd build/nuke
./build.sh BuildAll
./build.sh Test
./build.sh CI
```

**With parameters**:
```bash
./build.sh BuildAll --configuration Release
./build.sh Test --verbosity Verbose
```

**View available targets**:
```bash
./build.sh --help
```

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights

1. **Component Interface Design**
   - Component interfaces don't inherit from NukeBuild
   - Attribute injection (e.g., [Solution]) doesn't work with components
   - Manual property initialization required

2. **Target Framework Requirements**
   - Lunar components require .NET 9.0
   - Build projects must match component TFM
   - Application projects can remain on .NET 8.0

3. **Path Resolution**
   - Components provide smart path resolution via IWrapperPathComponent
   - RootDirectory vs EffectiveRootDirectory distinction important
   - Build configuration paths need careful calculation

4. **Project References**
   - Local ProjectReferences best for development
   - 5 levels up from build/nuke/build to infra-projects
   - CPM (Central Package Management) simplifies version management

### Process Insights

1. **Phased Approach Success**
   - Breaking into 4 phases enabled focused progress
   - Each phase independently testable
   - Clear completion criteria per phase

2. **Documentation Value**
   - Comprehensive phase docs enabled smooth handoffs
   - Examples and verification steps crucial
   - Known issues documented upfront

3. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Correctly ignored pre-existing test errors
   - Focused only on RFC-0040 objectives
   - Infrastructure vs execution distinction
