# Session Handover - Testing Infrastructure Improvements

**Date**: 2025-10-08  
**Time**: 17:15 CST  
**Version**: 0.0.1-378  
**Session Focus**: Test output strategy simplification and preparation for testing adjustments

---

## üéØ Current Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **Console Dungeon Application**
   - Running via PM2 (94 minutes uptime)
   - Render service functioning correctly
   - Game loop active with Terminal.Gui v2
   - No abort or service registration errors

2. **Test Output Strategy - SIMPLIFIED**
   - ‚úÖ Single-path approach: ALWAYS test versioned artifacts
   - ‚úÖ No mode switching (removed dev/CI dual modes)
   - ‚úÖ Clean implementation: `playwright.config.js` auto-detects version
   - ‚úÖ Test results go to: `build/_artifacts/v{VERSION}/web/test-reports/`

3. **Build System**
   - Versioned artifacts: `build/_artifacts/v0.0.1-378/`
   - Task orchestration working
   - PM2 integration stable

4. **Git Repository State**
   - All changes committed
   - 5 recent commits covering testing and plugin improvements
   - Clean working tree (many unstaged files from other work, but not blocking)

## üìù Test Infrastructure Changes This Session

### Philosophy Shift

**Before**: Dual-mode testing (dev vs CI)
- Used `ARTIFACT_OUTPUT=1` or `CI=true` flags
- Local directories for dev, artifacts for CI
- Complex conditional logic

**Now**: Single-path testing
- **Always test versioned artifacts**
- No environment variables needed
- One path for everyone (dev and CI)
- Philosophy: "Test the artifacts, not the source tree"

### Implementation

**File**: `development/nodejs/playwright.config.js`
```javascript
// Simple version detection, always uses artifacts
const version = getVersion();
const artifactBase = path.join(__dirname, '../../build/_artifacts', `v${version}`, 'web');
const outputDirs = {
  reportDir: path.join(artifactBase, 'test-reports'),
  resultsDir: path.join(artifactBase, 'test-results'),
};
```

**File**: `build/Taskfile.yml`
```yaml
test-e2e:
  desc: "Run E2E tests against versioned artifacts"
  deps: [init-dirs, build-all]
  dir: ../development/nodejs
  cmds:
    - echo "Testing versioned artifacts at {{.ARTIFACT_DIR}}/web"
    - pnpm test:e2e
```

### Current Test Suite

Located in: `development/nodejs/tests/e2e/`

**Test Files**:
1. `arrow-keys.spec.js` - Arrow key input testing
2. `arrow-keys-debug.spec.js` - Debug version
3. `capture-versioned-state.spec.js` - State capture with screenshots
4. `check-dungeon-display.spec.js` - Display verification
5. `docs-site.spec.js` - Documentation site tests
6. `terminal-gui-visual-verification.spec.js` - Terminal.Gui visuals
7. `verify-dungeon-gameplay.spec.js` - Gameplay verification

**Test Output Locations**:
- Reports: `build/_artifacts/v{VERSION}/web/test-reports/`
- Results: `build/_artifacts/v{VERSION}/web/test-results/`
- Screenshots: Captured in test-results
- Videos: Captured on failure
- Traces: Captured on failure

## üîç Areas for Testing Adjustments (Next Session)

### 1. Test Organization

**Current State**: Tests are somewhat scattered
- Some tests are integration tests
- Some are visual regression tests
- Some are smoke tests
- Naming doesn't clearly indicate test type

**Potential Improvements**:
- Reorganize by test category (smoke, integration, visual, e2e)
- Clear naming conventions
- Separate quick tests from slow tests
- Tag-based filtering

### 2. Test Reliability

**Observations**:
- Some tests may have timing issues
- PTY integration tests can be flaky
- Need to verify test stability with artifact-based approach

**Potential Improvements**:
- Review wait strategies
- Add explicit synchronization points
- Improve error messages
- Add retry logic for known flaky areas

### 3. Test Coverage

**Current Coverage**:
- ‚úÖ Basic functionality tests exist
- ‚úÖ Visual verification tests exist
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited keyboard interaction tests
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No game state progression tests
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No plugin loading/unloading tests

**Potential Improvements**:
- Expand keyboard interaction coverage
- Add game state transition tests
- Test plugin hot-reload scenarios
- Test error recovery paths

### 4. Test Execution Speed

**Current Approach**: Sequential execution (workers: 1)
- Needed to avoid PTY conflicts
- May be slower than necessary

**Potential Improvements**:
- Investigate parallel execution for non-PTY tests
- Separate PTY-dependent tests
- Optimize fixture setup/teardown
- Consider test sharding

### 5. Artifact-Based Testing Integration

**New Requirement**: Tests now run against built artifacts

**Implications to Verify**:
- Does `task build-all` need optimization?
- Should we cache artifacts between test runs?
- How to handle incremental changes during dev?
- Test what happens when artifacts are stale

### 6. Test Documentation

**Current State**: Basic README exists
- `development/nodejs/tests/e2e/README.md`
- `development/nodejs/TEST-OUTPUT-STRATEGY.md`

**Potential Improvements**:
- Document test categories and purposes
- Add troubleshooting guide
- Explain artifact testing workflow
- Document how to debug failing tests

## üí° Suggested Testing Adjustments (Priority Order)

### High Priority
1. **Test Categorization** - Organize tests by type (smoke/integration/visual)
2. **Test Reliability** - Fix flaky tests and improve wait strategies
3. **Artifact Testing Validation** - Ensure artifact-based testing works correctly

### Medium Priority
4. **Coverage Gaps** - Add missing test scenarios (plugin loading, error paths)
5. **Execution Speed** - Optimize test execution time
6. **Documentation** - Improve test documentation and troubleshooting guides

### Low Priority
7. **Test Utilities** - Create helper functions for common operations
8. **Visual Regression** - Set up proper visual regression testing
9. **Performance Tests** - Add performance benchmarks

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues / Considerations

### 1. Build-First Requirement
- Tests MUST run after `task build-all`
- No shortcuts or testing source directly
- Make sure build is fast (currently acceptable)

### 2. Version Bumping
- Every commit bumps GitVersion
- Test artifacts are versioned
- Old versions accumulate in `_artifacts/`
- May need cleanup strategy

### 3. PTY Service Dependency
- Many tests require PTY service running
- PTY conflicts require sequential execution
- Consider separating PTY-dependent tests

### 4. Playwright Update
- Currently using Playwright 1.55.1
- May need updates for latest features
- Check compatibility with Terminal.Gui testing

### 5. CI Integration
- Test strategy designed for CI
- Need to verify in actual CI environment
- May need GitHub Actions workflow updates
